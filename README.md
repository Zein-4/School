This repository is not for code but rather for my teachers so if your not my teacher then you dont need to be here
For my teachers, if you dont know how to use Github, just navigate to your the folder you desire, then download the word document/ powerpoint you desire

If you want to download a whole folder, which i dont suggest, you can download the zip file and extract it or download git for windows
the go into cmd then type git clone *(folder you desire)*.
